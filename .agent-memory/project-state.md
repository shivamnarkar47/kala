## 2026-08-02 20:24
Added docs/architecture.md with two mermaid diagrams: (1) module architecture + data-flow flowchart (entry points, runtime assembly, core loop, wire, guarded tools, persistence), (2) sequence diagram of one headless `hdp run` (SSE stream → DSML healing → tool execution → JSONL persist → answer). Diagram facts verified against actual imports in harness/*.py.

## 2026-08-04 — TUI workbench redesign
Rebuilt `harness/tui.py` around a compact session bar, framed conversation, context sidebar, compact composer, explicit Send/Cancel state, and clickable empty-state starters. Navigation locks during turns; session and agent context refresh outside the transcript. Added two interaction tests in `tests/test_tui.py`; full suite: 251 tests green.

## 2026-08-04 — home hero art + voice doctrine
Home screen now leads with the KAAL figlet wordmark (`KAAL_LOGO`) plus a simple Panchajanya conch (`MAHABHARATA_ART`) in `harness/art.py`, mirrored into the transcript. AGENTS.md gains §0 Voice & Output Doctrine: epic Mahabharata cadence in plain modern English (never pseudo-archaic) + strict i-have-adhd skill mandate with condensed core rules inlined; skill installed at `~/.agents/skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md` (visible to new sessions). Suite: 251 green.

## 2026-08-04 — response latency fixes
MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS 384k → 32k (bounds runaway reasoning, the dominant slow-response cost; 32k ≈ 96k chars keeps big tool payloads working). PROMPT_BUDGET now explicit 128k, not window-derived (was 616k); overflow-retry truncation uses PROMPT_BUDGET//2. TUI streams reasoning live (transcript mirror stays verbose-only). Tests updated (test_context boundary 968k, test_loop uses PROMPT_BUDGET). Suite: 275 green.

## 2026-08-04 — perceived-latency package
Gateway.warm() pre-opens the keep-alive connection (TCP+TLS handshake at TUI mount, background thread; first turn skips connect RTT; no-op on plain-urllib path). TUI thinking indicator shows live elapsed seconds. `kaal run` shows a live `💭 working Ns` ticker on TTY stderr (off for --verbose/--batch/pipes). Suite: 277 green.

## 2026-08-04 — kaal update
New `kaal update` subcommand: resolves the checkout (KAAL_INSTALL_DIR → ~/.local/share/kaal → running package's .git), git pull --ff-only, then reinstalls into the checkout's .venv (uv or pip, mirroring install.sh). Reports `updated: sha -> sha (subject)` or `up to date`. No checkout → clear error, exit 1. Tested against a real local git origin. Suite: 279 green.

## 2026-08-04 — termaid diagram support
`kaal diagrams <file.mmd>` renders mermaid via termaid (optional dep: pip install kaal[diagrams]); TUI gains `/diagram <path>` printing the Unicode-art render into the conversation. AGENTS.md §0 adds the STRICT mermaid rule: every plan must ship with an accurate ```mermaid diagram, previewed via termaid before delivery. Suite: 282 green.

## 2026-08-04 — mermaid auto-render
TUI turn end scans the finished markdown for ```mermaid fences and pipes each to termaid (stdin, worker thread, ≤3/turn); the Unicode art mounts below the answer in an accent diagram-box; transcript keeps verbatim source. Missing termaid → one dim notice. Cancelled turns skip rendering. Suite: 284 green.

## 2026-08-04 — update rebuilds on pull
`kaal update` now rebuilds (pip/uv install . into the checkout venv) ONLY when the pull brought a new commit; up-to-date runs skip the rebuild; a pulled checkout with no .venv errors with a re-run-install.sh hint. Tests assert exactly one rebuild command and its skip on the second run. Suite: 285 green.

## 2026-08-04 — inline diagrams + minimalistic mode
Termaid diagrams now mount INLINE at their fence positions: turn end splits the answer at each ```mermaid fence, renders all fences in one worker, and rebuilds the assistant block as interleaved markdown windows + diagram boxes. Switchable: Ctrl+D / /diagrams (priority binding, TextArea's ctrl+d delete-right overridden; Del still works). Top bar hidden by default (minimalistic), Ctrl+T / /topbar shows it. Suite: 287 green.

## 2026-08-04 — /models switcher + free tier
`/models` opens a catalog modal (35 models, sorted free-first then ascending price; each row shows id + `$in · $out per 1M` or `free`); Enter switches, persists as default (`~/.config/kaal/model`), rebuilds the gateway — free-tier models route to the zen/v1 endpoint (FREE_BASE_URL), paid to zen/go/v1. `kaal run` honors the saved default; `--model` flag still wins. Cost estimation uses the active model's rates (free → $0). Catalog verified against ~/.cache/opencode/models.json. Suite: 294 green.

## 2026-08-06 — resume hint actually works
`kaal run --resume <id>` without a prompt used to argparse-error ("prompt required") — the exact form the TUI's end-of-session hint prints. Now the missing prompt defaults to `continue`, so the hint works verbatim. Test added; verified against a real resumed session. Suite: 295 green.

## 2026-08-06 — kaal update tarball fallback
`kaal update` without git now does what install.sh's curl fallback does: fetch the main-branch tarball (urllib, filter="data" extraction), clear known code locations, overlay, keep .venv/unknown files, rebuild. `_resolve_checkout` accepts git-less checkouts (pyproject.toml marker) so tarball-installed dirs update. Suite: 297 green.

## 2026-08-06 — max-steps compaction
When a turn burns its step budget (steps >= max_steps-1; the final answer generation does not emit a step), the TUI folds all but the newest 10 conversation widgets into one dim line (`.compacted-notice`); the transcript mirror is untouched. Suite: 298 green.

## 2026-08-06 — epic voice is the defining character
AGENTS.md §0 strengthened: the Mahabharata voice now defines the agent's character, not a veneer — Mahabharata references (characters/places/situations as metaphors) are to be used mostly and naturally, with exact facts woven in between; precision still outranks flourish when clarity is at stake.

## 2026-08-06 — catalog refresh + /models UX
MODELS refreshed from ~/.cache/opencode/models.json: 48 entries (24 free zen/v1 + 24 paid opencode-go; new: mimo-v2.5-pro, trinity-large-preview-free, ling/laguna/ring/nemotron-ultra free, grok-code, big-pickle, …). /models modal upgraded: filter input (name/id substring), non-selectable Free/Paid section headers, active model ✓ + scrolled into view on open, ↑/↓ skip headers, Enter from filter activates.

session: Help me plan the next feature for this project. → ok

## 2026-08-16 — Go migration plan drafted
`docs/go-migration-plan.md` proposes a full Go port on branch `docs/go-migration-plan`: bubbletea TUI, stdlib-only core (+ x/sync/errgroup), goroutine AgentLoop with `chan AgentEvent`, 7 phases ≈ 20 person-days, parity gate before Python tree removal. Status: proposal — no code touched.
